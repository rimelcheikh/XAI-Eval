# Evaluating Knowledge-Based XAI


## Plausibility Metric for XAI Methods

This repository contains Python code to compute plausibility metric knwoledge-based XAI methods. The plausibility metric is designed to evaluate the alignement of explainability scores with human rationales.



### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Use the provided Python script to compute the plausibility metric:
python eval_plausibility.py
